          <h1>What is cyberbully?</h1>

          <p>
            Cyberbullying is when someone uses technology to harass, threaten,
            embarrass, or target another person. It happens on devices like
            smartphones, computers, tablets, and gaming systems. <br> <br> Cyberbullying
            hurts people, and in some cases is against the law. Sometimes
            cyberbullying can be easy to spot — for example, if your child shows
            you a text, comment, or post that is harsh, mean, or cruel. Other
            acts are less obvious, like posting someone's personal information,
            or using photos or videos that hurt or embarrass another person.
            Someone might make a fake account or screen name to harass and
            bully, so you don't know who the bully is.

            <h1>different kinds of Cyberbully?</h1>

            <p>
              There are many ways that someone can fall victim to or experience
              cyberbullying when using technology and the internet. Some common
              methods of cyberbullying are:
            </p>

            <div class="list">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Harassment</b> – When someone is being harassed online,
                  they are being subjected to a string of abusive messages or
                  efforts to contact them by one person or a group of people.
                  People can be harassed through social media as well as through
                  their mobile phone (texting and calling) and email. Most of
                  the contact the victim will receive will be of a malicious or
                  threatening nature.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Doxing</b> – Doxing is when an individual or group of
                  people distribute another person’s personal information such
                  as their home address, cell phone number or place of work onto
                  social media or public forums without that person’s permission
                  to do so. Doxing can cause the victim to feel extremely
                  anxious and it can affect their mental health.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Cyberstalking</b> – Similar to harassment, cyberstalking
                  involves the perpetrator making persistent efforts to gain
                  contact with the victim, however this differs from harassment
                  – more commonly than not, people will cyberstalk another
                  person due to deep feelings towards that person, whether they
                  are positive or negative. Someone who is cyberstalking is more
                  likely to escalate their stalking into the offline world.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Revenge porn</b> – Revenge porn, is when sexually explicit
                  or compromising images of a person have been distributed onto
                  social media or shared on revenge porn specific websites
                  without their permission to do so. Normally, images of this
                  nature are posted by an ex-partner, who does it with the
                  purpose of causing humiliation and damage to their reputation.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b> Account hacking</b> – Cyberbullies can hack into a
                  victim’s social media accounts and post abusive or damaging
                  messages. This can be particularly damaging for brands and
                  public figures.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>False profiles</b> – Fake social media accounts can be
                  setup with the intention of damaging a person or brand’s
                  reputation. This can easily be done by obtaining publicly
                  available images of the victim and making the account appear
                  as authentic as possible.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Slut shaming</b> – Slut shaming is when someone is called
                  out and labelled as a “slut” for something that they have done
                  previously or even just how they dress. This kind of
                  cyberbullying often occurs when someone has been sexting
                  another person and their images or conversations become
                  public. It is seen more commonly within young people and
                  teenagers but anyone can fall victim to being slut shamed.

          <div class="reasons">
            <h1>why do people cyberbully?</h1>

            <p>
              There are many reasons that someone might choose to cyberbully
              another person. Some of the most common reasons are:
            </p>

            <div class="reasons-list">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>They’ve been cyberbullied themselves</b> – Someone may
                  choose to cyberbully another person because they have been
                  through cyberbullying themselves. They might feel like it’s
                  okay to treat people in that way or find that it is the only
                  way to express their own pain.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>To fit in</b> – If someone sees another person being
                  cyberbullied by a group of people, they may feel that by
                  participating, they will ‘fit in’ or develop a new group of
                  friends themselves.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Home life</b> – The perpetrator may be having a difficult
                  home life and misplace their anger and frustration onto
                  someone else. Most of the time, this will happen when the
                  cyberbully doesn’t have anyone to talk to about what they are
                  going through.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Power</b> – Someone may choose to cyberbully in order to
                  feel powerful and have the ability to control a situation.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Jealously</b> – Jealously is one of the most common reasons
                  for cyberbullying, especially for teenagers and young people.
                  Growing up as teenager can be a difficult time as young people
                  are discovering themselves, and they may feel insecure about
                  their appearance. Because they feel insecure, they might
                  compare themselves to their peers which can result in envy
                  based cyberbullying and abuse.

            <h1>what to do if you are being cyberbullied?</h1>

            <p>
              If you are being cyberbullied, it can be easy to think that no one
              will understand or be able to help you – but that isn’t the case.
              See below for some advice for how to deal with cyberbullying.
            </p>

            <div class="actions-list">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Talk to someone</b> – When going through cyberbullying, it
                  is important that you build up a network of support from
                  friends, family and people you can trust. These people will be
                  able to help and support you. Talking to people in times of
                  crisis can not only add a voice of reason or rational thought,
                  it can also help you feel better for being able to share your
                  thoughts and feelings without judgement. If you are a young
                  person or teenager who has fallen victim to cyberbullying, you
                  might want to consider talking to a parent or teacher that you
                  feel you can trust. If the cyberbullying is occurring in
                  school or it is involving people who attend your school, a
                  teacher should be able to help you resolve the issue
                  effectively.

                <li>
                  <b> Don’t retaliate</b> – When people are cyberbullying
                  others, they are normally doing it for a reaction. If you
                  choose to not retaliate, they will eventually become bored and
                  move on.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Assess the threat</b> – If the cyberbully is sending you
                  messages of a threatening nature or you have reason to be
                  worried about your safety, you should contact law enforcement.
                  They will be able to help you with your immediate safety and
                  give you advice on what to do going forward.

            <p>
              There are many ways in which someone can be cyberbullied. The
